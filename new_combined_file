I saw a rainbow yesterday!
making a change on master branch, tryna see if it is mirrored in new_combinend_file on branch_trial2

so a staged change on master will be mirrored on branch_trial2
but can unstage if I want, when I am on branch_trial2
confirmed committing is the confirmation step before pushing changes to remote repo
now tryna test if staged change made on branch_trial2 is mirrored on master without committing.

ah! so even if I make a change on branch_trial2, if it is staged when I am on the branch,
it is mirrored on the master branch, also without committing - very strange. 
question: what's the point of having a branch on the local repo then, if any staged changes will be mirrored.
wouldn't staging vs not staging be enough to distinguish between saved and unsaved changes?

now even tested that, unstaged changes made on master branch ALSO are mirrored on branch_trial2
let's try unstaged changes on branch_trial2

trying whether unstaged changes on branch_trial2 are mirrored onto master branch.

oh wow, so even unstaged changes made on branch are mirrored onto master branch!
so what's the point of having a branch on the local repo LOL maybe there isn't any point. Let's try merging now.

just deleted branch_trial2;
it didnt allow me to do so until I have staged the changes and checkout into the master branch (left the branch_trial2).
now there's only master left.
Now try merging now. 
I think if I can't directly merge at the remote repo, I need to make a branch, and pull the remote repo,
and do the merging locally, then push. we see.

okay, so it seems that when I push, somehow it says I don't have a remote repo to this current master branch
so I made the remote repo as the upstream and successfully pushed.
Altho I realise when I refreshed the remote repo, there's no new_combined_file, because I have never committed any changes!
I never did any merging action, unsure where I need it.
trying to commit now and push.

very interesting now.
the last paragraph is the change I forgot to stage. But then I commited (for the first time in this sesh).
then I pushed (without needing to set remote origin as upstream again -> so just 'git push'), and then it worked,
i.e. on the remote repo, refreshing, I can see the new_combined_file,
most fascinatingly, without the last paragraph! yay!
so now let's try to merge after committing all this changes - tryna work out the difference between merge and push.

just staged. it does seem that merge only applies for merging local branches, which I have none now apart from the master only.
coz I deleted the branch_trial2 already.
need to solve: what's the point of merging if even unstaged changes are mirrored across branches?
